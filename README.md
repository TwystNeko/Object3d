Object3d
===========

A class for manipulating 3d objects

The example sketch relies on my modified SmartMatrix library, from here: https://github.com/TwystNeko/SmartMatrix/tree/fasterled
It also uses the FastLED 2.1 beta: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/FastLED2.1


But it should work with any display + library - like a TFT screen for example.
